	<p class="sentence1">"Hill Street Beverage Company Inc. is a maker of non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages, and they are looking to promote their first products into the new cannabis edible market. 
We decided to create and express the value of Hill Street products to potential customers. Therefore, we focused on how unique and different taste that the new product can bring to the customer in the very first time. This work is a part of the store’s poster which is used to approach mainly young adults who have experience with cannabis. We use the natural element in the poster to demonstrate the ingredient of the product which cloud represents the feeling of cannabis while water and leaves represent how fresh and clean the product is (because this is a non-alcoholic beverage). The outcome will create the first impression on the target demographic."</p>
	<p class="sentence2">The goal of the project was to create an illustration advertising for Air Canada where Taiwan is the destination.
The main content must create visual representations of how to persuade customers to the destination of the flight. The original idea of Taiwan is about the traditional dress that must be a signature. Based on the history of Taiwan, we decided the mixture of history and modern will represent the uniqueness of Taiwan. Therefore, the poster will represent the unique culture of Taiwan in which traveller can imagine how their destination might look like</p>
	<p class="sentence3">This is an artwork that represents a person’s initials (V and Y). The goal of the project was to create a gorgeous work, and also keep the shape of the letters. Therefore, black and white color scheme is chosen because this color scheme is the perfect example of a monochromatic color scheme that expresses the classic and timeless textures. With the help of this scheme, the shape of letter V and Y will be easy to recognize, and the details were designed based on ancient structure that generates mystery and antique. </p>

	<h2 class="bigtitle astonish" data-animation="fadeInRight">EDITORIAL</h2>
	<p class="bigdes astonish" data-animation="fadeInRight">This is an editorial illustration based on the steady stable source in a chaotic environment where meditation is the main topic. The illustration is the key in this project where visual communication is the core that does not need text to explain, and the reader will be able to understand the topic with the aid of visuals. The idea of meditation is based on the amount of stress people usually get during the COVID-19. As an informative magazine, people can find it relaxed and helpful when reading and research ways to meditate, and the main purpose is to help people relieve stress with reliable sources.</p>

	<h2 class="bigtitle2">PACKAGING</h2>
	<p class="pack1des">The goal of the project was to create quality craftsmanship and effective presentation of package design for a branding coffee product. The objective requires showing off the signature of the coffee to customers.</p>
	<p class="pack2des">The package is divided into four sections including logo, original, nutrition and name. The logo was carefully illustrated to the geometrical construct of “fin” which is the place where the coffee is produced. In addition to the original place and name of the brand, the word ‘fin’ is emphasized again to demonstrate the importance of “fin” in terms of coffee and Vietnam flavor as a way to ensure the quality of coffee flavor.</p>
